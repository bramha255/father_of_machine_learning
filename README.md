</p>

This repo has been divided as 
1. [Supervised learning](https://github.com/bramha255/father_of_machine_learning/tree/main/Tabular%20ML)
2. [Unsupervised learing](https://github.com/bramha255/father_of_machine_learning/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning)
3. Reinforcement learning - yet to be created
